//! As Rust developers we deeply care about safety and error handling - our programs are fast and
//! reliable. However, users never make it easy for us: they misunderstand instructions and break
//! things. When we catch them doing something they shouldn't be doing, we let them know (usually)
//! with an error message.
//!
//! Every command line tool prints handy messages to `stdout` from time to time, and to do so,
//! requires a function or two. I noticed that whenever I start a new project I tend to copy the
//! `util.rs` that contains those display functions from my last project. That is simply no good.
//!
//! It means that my error messages
//! - differ in style (since I regularly alter code in that util file);
//! - don't look like idiomatic Rust messages;
//! - require that `COPY + PASTE` operation for every new project.
//!
//! And I strongly believe that I am not alone in this. Take a look at [this code][1] by
//! [brain-lang]:
//!
//! ```
//! macro_rules! exit_with_error(
//!     ($($arg:tt)*) => { {
//!         use std::process;
//!         eprintln!($($arg)*);
//!         process::exit(1);
//!     } }
//! );
//! ```

//!
//! As you can see, they wrote this macro right next to the `main` function and it is the same
//! problem that I have with my util file.
//!
//! The `idioma` library solves all these problems forever. Here's how.
//!
//! In your `Cargo.toml` file.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! idioma = "*"
//! ```
//!
//! Include in any Rust file.
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate idioma;
//! ```
//!
//! Use within a function.
//!
//! ```
//! use idioma::*;
//! fn foo(i: i32) {
//!     if i != 42 {
//!         error("Your taste is appalling.").exit(1);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
